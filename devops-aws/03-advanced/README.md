# Level 3: Advanced

[← Back to DevOps & AWS](../README.md) | [Main README](../../README.md)

## Overview

Level 3 focuses on production-grade implementations, advanced patterns, security, and observability. You'll learn to build robust, scalable, and secure systems.

**Duration**: 8 weeks (80-120 hours)
**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Prerequisites**: Complete Level 2 (Intermediate)

## What You'll Learn

- Advanced Kubernetes patterns (Helm, operators, service mesh)
- AWS advanced services (ECS, EKS, Lambda, Step Functions)
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Security and compliance automation
- High availability and disaster recovery

## Modules

### Week 11-12: [Kubernetes Advanced](kubernetes-advanced/)

- Custom resources and operators
- Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
- Advanced scheduling and autoscaling

### Week 13-14: [AWS Advanced Services](aws-advanced-services/)
Serverless and container services.
- Amazon ECS and Fargate
- Amazon EKS (managed Kubernetes)
- AWS Lambda and serverless architectures
- Step Functions for orchestration
- CloudFormation and CDK

### Week 15-16: [Monitoring and Observability](monitoring-observability/)
Full-stack observability.
- Prometheus and Grafana
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)
- Log aggregation (ELK/EFK stack)
- SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs

### Week 17: [Security and Compliance](security-compliance/)
Security best practices.
- IAM advanced patterns
- Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Security scanning and SAST/DAST

### Week 18: [High Availability](high-availability/)
Resilient architectures.
- Multi-AZ and multi-region patterns
- Disaster recovery strategies
- Backup and restore automation
- Chaos engineering basics

## Capstone Project

**Production-Ready Microservices Platform**

2. Service mesh for traffic management
3. Full observability stack (metrics, logs, traces)
4. Automated security scanning
5. Multi-AZ high availability
6. CI/CD with progressive delivery
7. Infrastructure as Code
8. Disaster recovery procedures

## Certification Preparation

After completing Level 3, pursue:
- ✅ AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional
