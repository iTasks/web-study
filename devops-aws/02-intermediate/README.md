# Level 2: Intermediate

## Overview

Level 2 builds on your foundational knowledge to introduce production-ready DevOps practices. You'll learn CI/CD, infrastructure as code, container orchestration, and core cloud services.

**Duration**: 6 weeks (60-90 hours)
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Complete Level 1 (Fundamentals)

## What You'll Learn

- Automate builds and deployments with CI/CD pipelines
- Manage infrastructure as code using Terraform
- Orchestrate containers with Kubernetes
- Work with core AWS services for production use
- Configure systems at scale with Ansible

## Modules

### Week 5: [CI/CD Pipelines](ci-cd-pipelines/)
Implement continuous integration and deployment.
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Automated testing and quality gates
- Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
- Pipeline as code

### Week 6-7: [Infrastructure as Code with Terraform](terraform-iac/)
Manage cloud infrastructure through code.
- Terraform fundamentals and state management
- AWS resource provisioning
- Modules and composition
- Multi-environment strategies

### Week 8-9: [Kubernetes Basics](kubernetes-basics/)
Master container orchestration.
- Kubernetes architecture and concepts
- Deployments, services, and networking
- ConfigMaps, secrets, and volumes
- Scaling and self-healing

### Week 10: [AWS Core Services](aws-core-services/)
Production-ready cloud infrastructure.
- VPC and networking
- Load balancers and auto-scaling
- RDS and managed databases
- CloudWatch monitoring

### Week 10 (Optional): [Configuration Management](configuration-management/)
Automate system configuration.
- Ansible basics
- Playbooks and roles
- Inventory management

## Capstone Project

**Build a Complete CI/CD Pipeline**

Create an end-to-end automated pipeline that:
1. Builds a containerized application
2. Runs automated tests
3. Provisions infrastructure with Terraform
4. Deploys to Kubernetes on AWS
5. Implements monitoring and alerting

**Deliverables**:
- GitHub repository with application code
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Terraform modules for infrastructure
- Kubernetes manifests
- Documentation and architecture diagram

## Certification Preparation

After completing Level 2, you'll be ready for:
- ✅ AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
- ✅ Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) prep

## Prerequisites Check

Ensure you have mastered:
- [ ] Linux command line proficiency
- [ ] Git workflows and GitHub
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Basic AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM)
- [ ] Basic networking concepts

## Next Steps

After Level 2:
- **Level 3: Advanced** - Production patterns, security, observability
- **Real-world experience** - Apply skills in actual projects
- **Certification** - Pursue AWS or Kubernetes certifications
